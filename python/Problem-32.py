We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the
 digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through
 5 pandigital.The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254,
 containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

 Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity
 can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
 HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than
       one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.

#--------------------------- APPROACH -------------------------------------------#
# 1. We are seeking for three numbers X, Y and Z so that X times Y = Z. We first note this excludes
#    the possibility of the number of digits Z to be 1, 2 or 3 - e.g for Z to be 3 digit, both X
#    and Y must be 3 digit. However, the product of the two smallest 3 digit numbers is 100 * 100
#    which is not 3 digit number. 
# 2. The number of digits in Z is no more than 4 since (considering that there are only six digits
#    left for this possibility)
#   a. the product of 2 three digit number (at least those of interest to us) is at least a four
#      digit number (as above),
#   b. the product of 2 digit number and 4 digit number is at least 5 digits
# 3. Hence the only possibilities we have is Z4 = X2 times Y3 or Z4 = X1 times Y4 where the numbers 
#    after the letters signifies the number of digits. 
# 4. So the largest value of Z is 9999.
# 5. So a first step here would be to include all numbers starting from 9999 that
#   a. do not contain any 0,
#   b. do not repeat numbers from 1 to 9 two or more times.
#   c. is not prime.
#   as the set of all possible values of Z.
